# ID Card Swiper

This Processing code reads an ID card and compiles it into a CSV spreadsheet, which can then be automatically emailed to a recipient. It is currently set up to read Carroll University ID cards and is used for taking attendance at Music Performance Lab, but can be configured to read other ID cards as well.

It requires a USB card reader.
